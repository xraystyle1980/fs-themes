# Project challenge
Content is king, or queen, or president. Take this blob of text, meta details, and this image, and lay it out using HTML + CSS (or JS if you really want). Now create 2 more thematic alternatives (could affect layout, colors, anything, get creative!) and a means to toggle between those themes (JS). Ideally you should have three treatments of the same content and an interactive means of viewing them. The finished thing should represent what you think looks good on screen and looks elegant in code. No clever tricks or gotchas here, just trying to figure out some baselines for visual and procedural preferences.
