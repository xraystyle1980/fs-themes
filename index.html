              <p>But when the Count opened his eyes, he nearly dropped his spoon. For standing at the edge of his table was the young girl with the penchant for yellow—studying him with that unapologetic interest peculiar to children and dogs. Adding to the shock of her sudden appearance was the fact that her dress today was in the shade of a lemon.</p>
              <p>"Where did they go?" she asked, without a word of introduction.</p>
              <p>"I beg your pardon. Where did who go?"</p>
              <p>She tilted her head to take a closer look at his face.</p>
              <p>"Why, your moustaches."</p>
              <p>The Count had not much cause to interact with children, but he had been raised well enough to know that a child should not idly approach a stranger, should not interrupt him in the middle of a meal, and certainly should not ask him questions about his personal appearance. Was the minding of one’s own business no longer a subject taught in schools?</p>
              <p>"Like swallows," the Count answered, "they traveled elsewhere for the summer."</p>
              <p>Then he fluttered a hand from the table into the air in order to both mimic the flight of the swallows and suggest how a child might follow suit.</p>
              <p>She nodded to express her satisfaction with his response.</p>
              <p>"I too will be traveling elsewhere for part of the summer."</p>
              <p>The Count inclined his head to indicate his congratulations.</p>
              <p>"To the Black Sea," she added.</p>
              <p>Then she pulled back the empty chair and sat.</p>
              <p>"Would you like to join me?" he asked.</p>
              <p>By way of response, she wiggled back and forth to make herself comfortable then rested her elbows on the table. Around her neck hung a small pendant on a golden chain, some lucky charm or locket. The Count looked toward the young lady’s governess with the hopes of catching her attention, but she had obviously learned from experience to keep her nose in her book.</p>
              <p>The girl gave another canine tilt to her head.</p>
              <p>"Is it true that you are a count?"</p>
              <p>"'Tis true."</p>
              <p>Her eyes widened.</p>
              <p>"Have you ever known a princess?"</p>
              <p>"I have known many princesses."</p>
              <p>Her eyes widened further, then narrowed.</p>
              <p>"Was it terribly hard to be a princess?"</p>
              <p>"Terribly."</p>
